Blokkok is a modular android app where you can plug in and out modules to remove, add, or modify features to it. This modular approach allows users to modify the app functionality without compiling the entire app.

Blokkok is targeted to be a full-fledged hackable Android App IDE for Android. But dont let that fool you, you can fully change Blokkok to anything else you wanted!
